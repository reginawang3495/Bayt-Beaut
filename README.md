# Bayt-Beaut
Created by: Hajar Azzam and Regina Wang

## About:
See the world through the eyes of Nawar, our female Arab protagonist, as she matures and makes important life decisions under the scrutiny of her endearing family. Bayt Beaut, a virtual reality role-playing game, explores the dynamics of Arab families by unfolding the complicated layers of love, protection and pride. By living through various stages in Narwar’s life and engaging in conversations with family members, the game ultimately challenges Arab stereotypes and addresses gender bias by putting the western views of oppression of Arab women into perspective. The game’s aesthetics takes inspiration from the typical 80’s anime, and is set in a traditional Arab Salon (living room). 

## Medium:

## Tools needed:
This game was created in Unity and requires at least Unity 2018.3.5 to run in Unity since this game has not been deployed to any other platform. Bayt Beaut also requires an HTC Vive and also currently requires a Google Oauth key for Cloud Speech API.
